# playlist-memes
## initial idea
1. take a set of music memes that have album covers/music posters on them.  
2. make a template out of them by marking rectangles on the image. number of rectangles=number of covers in the meme  
3. make a script thats asks for a users youtube music playlist > grabs a few random cover arts > pastes them on the template
